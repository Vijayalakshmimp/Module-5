# Arithmetic Operations Using Multiple Inheritance in Python

This Python program demonstrates **multiple inheritance** by performing basic arithmetic operations â€” Addition, Subtraction, and Division â€” using three classes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program to calculate **Add, Sub & Division** using **Multiple Inheritance**.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Define `Calculation1` class**
   - Contains `Summation(a, b)` method to return the sum of two numbers.
2. **Define `Calculation2` class**
   - Contains `Subtraction(a, b)` method to return the difference of two numbers.
3. **Define `Derived` class**
   - Inherits from both `Calculation1` and `Calculation2`.
   - Contains `Division(a, b)` method to return the division result.
4. **Input**
   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
5. **Process**
   - Create an object of the `Derived` class.
   - Call `Summation`, `Subtraction`, and `Division` methods.
6. **Output**
   - Display the results of the three operations.

## ðŸ’» Program 
class Addition:

    def add(self, a, b):

        return a + b

class Subtraction:
    
    def subtract(self, a, b):
    
        return a - b

class Calculator(Addition, Subtraction):
    
    def divide(self, a, b):
    
        if b != 0:
        
            return a / b
        
        else:
        
            return "Division by zero error!"
            
a = int(input())

b = int(input())

calc = Calculator()

print(calc.add(a, b))

print(calc.subtract(a, b))

print(calc.divide(a, b))

## Result

Thus, the Python program to calculate **Add, Sub & Division** using **Multiple Inheritance** is executed and verified successfully.
